This code allows easy customization of the following reason API extensions in Kibo:

* Refund reasons: [https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/refund-reasons-after](https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/refund-reasons-after)
* Order Cancellation Reason: [https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/cancellation-reasons-after](https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/cancellation-reasons-after)
* Subscription reasons: [https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/subscription-reasons-after](https://docs.kibocommerce.com/help/subscription-reasons-after)

If you just want to use this, all you need to do is install via [One Click Link](https://developer.mozu.com/console/marketplace/mzint.custom_reasons.1.0.0). After installing, go to your tenant, System → Customization → API Extensions, then modify the items. It will copy the default items for each reason at the time of installation to the Arc config. Simply modify the Action Management API Extensions Configuration, save, and you will see the reasons update.

This Arc.js code is implemented in TypeScript and can give you a feel for using TypeScript as a base for API Extensions.
